<h2>FAVOURITE QOUTE AND REVIEW OF TOP THREE BOOKS</h2>
<hr />

<h3>KITE RUNNER</h3>
<h4>-by Albert Camus</h4>
<h6>Favourite Qoute:</h6>
<p>“I had only a little time left and I didn't want to waste it on God.”<br />
    ― Albert Camus</p>
<h6>REVIEW:</h6>
<p>“This book isn't particularly insightful or well-written, but that is in no way unusual in bestsellers. The problem
    is that Americans are going to use this book to justify their ignorance about the problems in the east. This book
    will make people feel better about themselves, instead of helping them to think better about the world.

    For an actually insightful, touching view of the Afghan conflict, I would suggest avoiding this bit of naive
    melodrama and looking up Emmanuel Guibert's 'The Photographer'.</p>

<h3>THE STRANGER</h3>
<h4>-by Khaled Hosseini</h4>
<h6>Favourite Qoute:</h6>
<p>“There is only one sin. and that is theft... when you tell a lie, you steal someones right to the truth.”<br />
    ―Khaled Hosseini</p>
<h6>REVIEW:</h6>
<p>“I liked the book very much. It drives home the insignificance of constantly analysing yourself and your emotions and
    needing to know exactly what and how you’re feeling every second. The book is packed with a lot of different
    messages and ideas but this stood out to me the most. And the protagonist becomes an outsider to society exactly
    because of this reason; he refuses to lie and fabricate and extrapolate the truth, ie, he is EXTREMELY honest, but
    never in a malicious way or with malicious intent. He just refuses to make or agree with statements just because
    society adheres to them and just because they are socially acceptable. Mersault’s character truly is an eye opener
    and really feels refreshing to read; he’s honest but isn’t insulting. The flow of the writing feels effortless and
    everything is described almost intimately like a diary. Absolutely loved it, it was really enthralling; I honestly
    didn’t think i would be so engrossed in a book written in the 1940s.</p>
